## Intro


**Macalester College** is in the *Twin Cities*.
It has:

- four seasons
- bagpipes
- delightful students

Check it out for yourself:

## Exercise 1: Deduce Quarto features

Check out the appearance and contents of this document. Thoughts? 

**It looks cool.**

In the toolbar at the top of this document, **Render** the .qmd file into a .html file. Where is this file stored? Thoughts about its appearance / contents? Can you edit it?

**They are stored in my ica folder. We edit the .qmd file here, and render the .qmd to get an updated .html file. The .html is also stored in my ica folder.**

Toggling between the .qmd and .html files, explain the purpose of the following features in the .qmd file:        

`*` *This italicizes* 

`**` **This bolds**

`#` This comments the line in a code chunk

`-` - This makes a bullet point

`\` \Thisdoessomething

`![](url)` This links a url



## Exercise 2: Code

How does this appear in the .qmd? The .html? So...?!

seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)

It appears the same in .qmd and the .html because it's not in a code chunk.

## Exercise 3: Chunks

Quarto isn't a mind reader -- we must distinguish R code from text.
We do so by putting code inside an **R chunk**:

```{r}
seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)
```

- Put the `seq()` code in the chunk.
- Press the green arrow in the top right of the chunk. What happens in the qmd?
- Render. What appears in the html: R code, output, or both?

Both the R code and the output appeared. But the code is me telling the R what I want it to do and the output is what I want. 

## Exercise 4: Practice

- Use R code to create the following sequence: 10 10 10 10
- Store the sequence as `four_tens`.
- Use an R function (which we haven't learned!) to add up the numbers in `four_tens`.

```{r}
four_tens <- rep(x = 10, times = 4)

four_tens

sum(four_tens)
#the function 'sum' adds the values within its parentheses.
```


## Exercise 5: Fix this code

Code is a form of communication, and the code below doesn't cut it.

Put the code in a chunk and fix it.

Rep(x = 1, times = 10)
seq(from=100,to=1000,length=20)
theNumberofStudentsinthisclass<-27

```{r}
rep(x = 1, times = 10)
seq(from=100,to=1000,length=20)
theNumberofStudentsinthisclass<-27
#the error was that the 'r' in rep was capitalized
```

## Exercise 6: Comments

Run the chunk below.
Notice that R ignores anything in a line starting with a pound sign (`#`).
If we took the `#` away we'd get an error!

```{r}
# This is a comment
4 + 5
```

We'll utilize this feature to **comment our code**, i.e. leave short notes about what our code is doing.
Below, replace the `???` with an appropriate comment.

```{r}
# Here the function temperature_f is set to mean the same thing as temperature_c
temperature_c <- 10
temperature_f <- temperature_c * 9/5 + 32
temperature_f
```
